Simple Library for Graphics (LibSL)

This software is a computer program whose purpose is to offer a set of
tools to simplify programming real-time computer graphics applications
under OpenGL and DirectX.

therefore means  that it is reserved for developers  and  experienced
professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
encouraged to load and test the software's suitability as regards their
